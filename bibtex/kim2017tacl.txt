        abstract = {Much of scientific progress stems from previously
published findings, but searching through the vast sea of scientific
publications is difficult. We often rely on metrics of scholarly authority
to find the prominent authors but these authority indices do not
differentiate authority based on research topics. We present Latent
Topical-Authority Indexing (LTAI) for jointly modeling the topics,
citations, and topical authority in a corpus of academic papers. Compared to
previous models, LTAI differs in two main aspects. First, it explicitly
models the generative process of the citations, rather than treating the
citations as given. Second, it models each author's influence on citations
of a paper based on the topics of the cited papers, as well as the citing
papers. We fit LTAI to four academic corpora: CORA, Arxiv Physics, PNAS, and
Citeseer. We compare the performance of LTAI against various baselines,
starting with the latent Dirichlet allocation, to the more advanced models
including author-link topic model and dynamic author citation topic model.
The results show that LTAI achieves improved accuracy over other similar
models when predicting words, citations and authors of publications. },
